data from dunbabin on root hairs:
Below is the root hair info that Yinglong measured.  I don’t think we have an idea of hairiness of different root classes by age.  The measurements below were taken on 6-day old seedlings.  We saw a big variation in hairiness in the genotypes grown in nutrient solution, but this didn’t seem to be dominated by genotype or root classes, but more by local growth conditions.  Maybe you could check the root images Yinglong and see if you can pick out any patterns in where and when the root hairs grew?
